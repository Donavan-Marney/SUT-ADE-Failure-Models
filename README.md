# SUT-ADE-Failure-Models
Development of physical probabilistic failure models
This is a workspace to develop and store algorithms associated with estimating pipe failures
It will include the underlying model/code developed by Hendrik W and Rajeev (Pathma)
This code deals with internal pressure transients measured using Pressure Monitors (using safety factors) and soil induced corrosion (using Linear Polarisation Resistance) of metallic pipes
It is envisaged that it will evolve to include a transient model for water hammer and surge analyses using the  Method of Characteristics (MOC) to transform PDEs of fluid flow into a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) along characteristic lines. The MOC has been developed
